<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the whole VeBeGe solution (C++ driver + C# service) as x64.

.DESCRIPTION
    Locates MSBuild via vswhere (so it works on any machine with a suitable
    Visual Studio install) and builds the solution. All projects output to a
    single distributable folder in the repo root: Debug\ or Release\.

    Requires Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 with:
      - Desktop development with C++  (for the virtual-camera driver)
      - .NET desktop development      (for the service)

.PARAMETER Configuration
    Debug (default) or Release.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1 -Configuration Release
